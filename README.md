# Global Illumination Ray Tracer

This project aims to build a 3D renderer using ray tracing in C++, for the CSCI 711 Global Illumination class at RIT.

This is a semester-long project with the goal of reproducing the following image:

The project consists of seven basic checkpoints (the first was simply determining relative object values):
  - [x] Setting the Scene
  - [x] Framework
  - [ ] Phong Illumination
  - [ ] Procedural Textures
  - [ ] Reflection
  - [ ] Transmission
  - [ ] Tone Reproduction

Progress is detailed [here](https://www.ekliot.com/makes/ray_tracer).

There are additional semi-mandatory advanced checkpoints that will be detailed in the future.
