# Global Illumination Ray Tracer

This project aims to build a 3D renderer using ray tracing in C++ for a computer graphics course.

This is a semester-long project with the goal of reproducing the following image:

The project consists of seven basic checkpoints (the first was simply determining relative object values):
  - [x] Setting the Scene
  - [x] Framework
  - [x] Phong Illumination
  - [x] Procedural Textures
  - [x] Reflection
  - [x] Transmission
  - [ ] Tone Reproduction

Progress is detailed [here](https://www.ekliot.com/makes/ray_tracer).

There are additional semi-mandatory advanced checkpoints that will be detailed in the future.
